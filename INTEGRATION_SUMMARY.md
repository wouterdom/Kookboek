# Shopping List & Weekly Menu Integration Layer - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the integration layer and state management implementation for the Shopping List and Weekly Menu features. The implementation ensures seamless data flow and proper state synchronization across all views.

## State Management Approach

### React Context Pattern
We implemented a **React Context** approach (`WeekMenuProvider`) for managing weekmenu state globally across the entire application. This ensures bookmark icons are synchronized across all views without prop drilling or redundant API calls.

**Key Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for weekmenu status
- Automatic synchronization across homepage, detail pages, and search results
- Efficient state updates with minimal re-renders
- Easy to consume via `useWeekMenu()` hook

### Context Location
`C:\Users\wdom\Kookboek\contexts\weekmenu-context.tsx`

## Bookmark Synchronization

### How It Works

1. **Global State Tracking**
   - Context maintains a `Set<string>` of bookmarked recipe IDs
   - Loaded on mount and refreshed when week changes
   - Updates immediately when recipes are added/removed from weekmenu

2. **State Flow**
   ```
   User clicks bookmark → addToWeekMenu() called
   → Database updated → Context state updated
   → All mounted RecipeCard components re-render with new state
   → Bookmark icons update automatically
   ```

3. **Automatic Synchronization**
   - No event bus needed - React Context handles re-renders automatically
   - Any component using `useWeekMenu()` gets updated state
   - Recipe cards across all views stay in sync

4. **Week Navigation**
   - When user changes week in weekmenu view, context refreshes bookmarks
   - Only recipes in current week show as bookmarked
   - Prevents showing bookmarks from different weeks

## Files Created

### 1. Week Utilities
**File:** `C:\Users\wdom\Kookboek\lib\week-utils.ts`

**Functions:**
- `getWeekMonday(date)` - Get Monday of any week
- `getCurrentWeekMonday()` - Get current week's Monday
- `addWeeks(date, weeks)` - Navigate between weeks
- `getWeekNumber(date)` - ISO 8601 week numbering
- `formatWeekRange(monday)` - Dutch week format ("Week 4 - 20-26 januari 2025")
- `getDayName(index)` / `getShortDayName(index)` - Dutch day names
- `formatDateForDB(date)` - Database format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `isSameWeek(date1, date2)` - Week comparison
- `isToday(date)` / `isCurrentWeek(monday)` - Date checks

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Week always starts on Monday (index 0)
- All dates normalized to midnight for consistency
- ISO 8601 week numbering standard
- Dutch language support for display

### 2. Servings Calculator
**File:** `C:\Users\wdom\Kookboek\lib\servings-calculator.ts`

**Functions:**
- `scaleIngredientAmount(amount, originalServings, newServings)` - Main scaling function
- `calculateNewAmounts(ingredients, original, new)` - Batch calculation
- `combineAmounts(amounts[])` - Aggregate same ingredients from multiple recipes
- `normalizeIngredientName(name)` - Normalize for matching/aggregation
- `smartRound(amount)` - Intelligent rounding based on magnitude

**Smart Handling:**
- Preserves "naar smaak", "snufje", "beetje" without scaling
- Handles decimals (400g → 200g), fractions (1/2 → 1/4), and mixed (1 1/2 → 3/4)
- Intelligent rounding: < 1 → 0.1, 1-10 → 0.5, 10-100 → 5, 100+ → 10
- Unit-aware formatting
- Common fraction conversion (0.5 → "1/2")

**Examples:**
```typescript
scaleIngredientAmount("400g pasta", 4, 2)  // → "200g pasta"
scaleIngredientAmount("1 1/2 kopje", 4, 6) // → "2 1/4 kopje"
scaleIngredientAmount("naar smaak", 4, 2)  // → "naar smaak" (unchanged)
```

### 3. WeekMenu Context
**File:** `C:\Users\wdom\Kookboek\contexts\weekmenu-context.tsx`

**State:**
- `bookmarkedRecipeIds: Set<string>` - All recipes in current week
- `isLoading: boolean` - Loading state
- `currentWeek: Date` - Current week Monday

**Actions:**
- `addToWeekMenu(recipeId, onSuccess)` - Add recipe, trigger callback
- `removeFromWeekMenu(recipeId)` - Remove recipe
- `isRecipeInWeekMenu(recipeId)` - Check bookmark status
- `refreshBookmarks()` - Reload from database
- `clearWeek(weekDate)` - Clear entire week
- `setCurrentWeek(date)` - Change week (triggers refresh)

**Database Integration:**
- Queries `weekly_menu_items` table
- Filters by `week_date` (Monday of the week)
- Creates items with `day_of_week: null` initially (no day assigned)
- Inherits `servings_default` from recipe

### 4. Ingredient Selection Popup
**File:** `C:\Users\wdom\Kookboek\components\ingredient-selection-popup.tsx`

**Features:**
- Nothing selected by default
- Servings adjuster with +/- buttons
- Real-time amount scaling as servings change
- Individual amount editing with manual override
- "was X" indicator for changed amounts
- Select all / deselect all toggle
- Disabled state when no ingredients selected

**User Flow:**
1. Popup opens after bookmarking recipe
2. User adjusts servings (all amounts update proportionally)
3. User can manually edit specific amounts (won't recalculate on servings change)
4. User selects ingredients to add to grocery list
5. Click "Toevoegen (X)" to confirm or "Overslaan" to cancel
6. Selected ingredients sent to grocery list API

**State Management:**
- `servings` - Current servings
- `selectedIngredients` - Set of selected ingredient IDs
- `adjustedAmounts` - Map of scaled amounts
- `manualEdits` - Set of manually edited ingredient IDs (won't auto-recalculate)

## Files Updated

### Recipe Card Component
**File:** `C:\Users\wdom\Kookboek\components\recipe-card.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added bookmark button next to heart icon
- Integrated `useWeekMenu()` hook for state
- Bookmark click handler:
  - If in weekmenu: removes recipe
  - If not in weekmenu: adds recipe + shows ingredient popup
- Fetches recipe with ingredients when bookmarking
- Passes data to `IngredientSelectionPopup`
- Visual state: filled bookmark = in weekmenu, outline = not in weekmenu

**Button Positioning:**
- Heart icon: top-right corner
- Bookmark icon: top-right, next to heart (right-12)
- Delete icon: bottom-right (absolute positioning)

### Root Layout
**File:** `C:\Users\wdom\Kookboek\app\layout.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `WeekMenuProvider` wrapper around children
- Ensures context available to all components in app
- No prop drilling needed

## Integration Points

### Bookmark State Synchronization

**Current Implementation:**
✅ Recipe cards use `useWeekMenu()` hook
✅ Hook checks `isRecipeInWeekMenu(recipe.id)`
✅ Context updates when recipes added/removed
✅ All mounted recipe cards re-render with new state

**Where It Works:**
- Homepage recipe grid
- Recipe detail page (if RecipeCard used there)
- Search results (if RecipeCard used there)
- Any future views using RecipeCard

**How to Extend:**
If bookmark icon needed elsewhere (e.g., detail page header):
```typescript
import { useWeekMenu } from '@/contexts/weekmenu-context'

const { isRecipeInWeekMenu, addToWeekMenu, removeFromWeekMenu } = useWeekMenu()
const isBookmarked = isRecipeInWeekMenu(recipeId)
```

### Ingredient Flow

**Complete Flow:**
1. User clicks bookmark on recipe card
2. `addToWeekMenu()` adds recipe to `weekly_menu_items` table
3. Success callback fetches recipe with ingredients
4. `IngredientSelectionPopup` opens with recipe data
5. User adjusts servings (amounts scale automatically)
6. User selects specific ingredients
7. Click "Toevoegen" → `onConfirm` callback with grocery items
8. Recipe card's `handleIngredientConfirm()` receives items
9. **TODO:** Call grocery list API to add items (currently console.log)

**Next Steps for Full Integration:**
```typescript
// In recipe-card.tsx handleIngredientConfirm
const response = await fetch('/api/groceries', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ items: groceryItems })
})
```

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Bookmark Synchronization Test
**Steps:**
1. Open homepage with recipe grid
2. Click bookmark on Recipe A → icon fills
3. Navigate to recipe detail page for Recipe A
4. Verify bookmark icon is filled (if RecipeCard used)
5. Navigate back to homepage
6. Verify Recipe A bookmark still filled
7. Click bookmark again → icon becomes outline
8. Refresh page → bookmark remains outline (state refreshed from DB)

**Expected Result:** Bookmark state consistent across all views

### 2. Ingredient Selection Test
**Steps:**
1. Bookmark Recipe B (default 4 servings, has "400g pasta")
2. Popup opens showing all ingredients
3. Verify nothing is selected by default
4. Change servings to 2
5. Verify "400g pasta" becomes "200g pasta"
6. Verify "was 400g pasta" appears next to amount
7. Manually change to "250g pasta"
8. Change servings to 3
9. Verify manually edited amount stays "250g pasta" (not recalculated)
10. Select ingredient and click "Toevoegen (1)"
11. Verify popup closes and console logs grocery item

**Expected Result:** Servings calculations work correctly, manual edits preserved

### 3. Week Navigation Test
**Steps:**
1. Bookmark Recipe C in current week
2. Navigate to weekmenu page (TODO: create this page)
3. Change to next week
4. Verify context updates `currentWeek`
5. Navigate back to homepage
6. Verify Recipe C bookmark is NOT filled (different week)
7. Navigate to weekmenu, change back to current week
8. Navigate to homepage
9. Verify Recipe C bookmark IS filled again

**Expected Result:** Bookmarks only show for current week

### 4. Clear Week Test
**Steps:**
1. Bookmark Recipes D, E, F
2. Verify all three show filled bookmarks
3. Call `clearWeek(currentWeek)` from weekmenu page
4. Verify all three bookmarks change to outline
5. Verify context `bookmarkedRecipeIds` is empty Set

**Expected Result:** All bookmarks update when week cleared

### 5. Amount Aggregation Test (Future)
**Steps:**
1. Bookmark Recipe X (has "200g sugar")
2. Select sugar for grocery list
3. Bookmark Recipe Y (has "150g sugar")
4. Select sugar for grocery list
5. Check grocery list
6. Verify "350g sugar" (aggregated) or "200g sugar + 150g sugar"

**Expected Result:** Same ingredients combined intelligently

## Performance Considerations

### Context Re-renders
- Context only updates when bookmarks change
- Uses `Set<string>` for O(1) lookup
- Recipe cards only re-render when bookmark state changes for their recipe

### Database Queries
- Single query per week load (all bookmarks at once)
- No per-recipe queries
- Efficient filtering with indexed `week_date` column

### Caching Strategy
- Context holds bookmarks in memory
- Refreshes only on week change or explicit action
- No unnecessary API calls

## Error Handling

### Current Implementation
- Try-catch blocks in all async operations
- Error messages shown via Modal component
- Console logging for debugging

### Future Improvements
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Retry logic for failed API calls
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback
- Network error detection
